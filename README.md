Key Features of the Project:
1. Display of Food Items: Users can view a list of different food items available in the fast-food restaurant.
2. Type Filtering: Users can select a type of dish (burgers, pizza, salads, chicken) and filter the list to view only the items of the selected type.
3. Price Filtering: Users can choose a price range (5-10$, 7-12$, 8-15$, 25$) and filter the list of dishes to see only those that fall within the selected price range.
4. Interactive Elements: Users can hover over menu items to see an effect that scales up the size, providing a more engaging interaction.

Technologies Used in the Project:
- React: The React library was used to develop the user interface and manage the application's state.
- JavaScript: The project is written in JavaScript, the programming language commonly used in React applications.
- CSS: CSS was used for styling the components and creating a visually appealing user interface.

Project Benefits:
- User-Friendly: The application's user interface is simple and intuitive, making navigation and menu filtering easy for users.
- Enhanced Viewing Experience: Thanks to the optimized layout and design, users can effortlessly browse and select dishes that match their preferences.
- Responsiveness: The application design is responsive, adapting to different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

FastFood serves as an example project showcasing my web development skills using React and other modern technologies. It is a valuable addition to my portfolio, demonstrating my ability to create interactive web applications with a user-friendly interface.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
